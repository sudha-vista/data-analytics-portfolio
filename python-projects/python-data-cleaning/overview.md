# Python Data Cleaning Project

This project demonstrates basic data cleaning and analysis using Python and Pandas. 

Key steps include:
- Reading student data from CSV
- Filling missing marks with average values
- Renaming columns for clarity
- Calculating summary statistics (average, highest, lowest marks)
- Identifying the top-performing student
- Saving cleaned data to a new CSV file

The goal is to prepare messy data for analysis and generate meaningful insights.
